Tutorial Overview
-----------------

**Basic Tutorials:**

1. :doc:`basic_analysis` - Load data, find peaks, and perform basic fitting
2. :doc:`advanced_fitting` - Advanced fitting techniques and optimization
3. :doc:`multi_element` - Analyzing multi-element samples

**Advanced Topics:**

4. :doc:`strain_analysis` - Strain and displacement mapping
5. :doc:`batch_processing` - Processing multiple images efficiently

**Examples:**

6. :doc:`examples` - Real-world case studies and example datasets

Prerequisites
-------------

Before starting the tutorials, make sure you have:

- QEM installed (see :doc:`../installation`)
- Basic knowledge of Python and NumPy
- Understanding of electron microscopy concepts
- Jupyter notebook environment (recommended)

Sample Data
-----------

Many tutorials use sample datasets that can be downloaded from:

- `QEM Example Data Repository <https://github.com/zezhong-zhang/qem/tree/master/data>`_
- Individual datasets linked in each tutorial

Jupyter Notebooks
-----------------

All tutorials are available as Jupyter notebooks in the ``examples/`` directory of the QEM repository. You can run them interactively:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/zezhong-zhang/qem.git
   cd qem/examples
   jupyter lab
